====
libPF is a simple, easy to use, C++ template library for particle filters.
All you have to do to implement a particle filter using this library is:

- Create a state
- Create a movement model for your state
- Create a measurement model for your state

The library does all the rest.

Please see the documentation in the source files for more information.
